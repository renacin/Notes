*Notes Taken From: Fundamentals Of Data Engineering* - Joe Reis & Matt Housley


Data engineering has existed in some form since companies started doing things with data—such as predictive, analysis, descriptive analytics, and reports—and came into sharp focus alongside the rise of data science in the 2010s.


==***1. What Is Data Engineering?***==
- Is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning. Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering.

==***2. What Is A Data Engineer?***==
- An individual who manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.

==***3. Data Engineering Lifecycle?***==
- The data engineering lifecycle shifts the conversation away from technology and toward the data itself and the end goals that it must serve. The stages of the data engineering lifecycle are as follows:

	- Generation
	- Storage
	- Ingestion
	- Transformation
	- Serving

+ There are undercurrents—critical ideas across the entire lifecycle. These include security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering.

==***4. Big Data?***==
- Defined it means “extremely large data sets that maybe analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating to human behaviour and interactions.” Another famous and succinct description of big data is the three Vs of data: Velocity, Variety, & Volume.
- The term big data has lost steam. What happened? Simplification. Developers, started looking for ways to abstract, simplify, and make big data available without the high administrative overhead and cost of managing their clusters. The term big data is essentially a relic. Today, data is moving faster than ever and growing ever larger, but big data processing has become so accessible that it no longer merits a separate term; every company aims to solve its data problems, regardless of actual data size. Big data engineers are now simply data engineers.


==***4. Data Maturity?***==
- Data maturity is the progression toward higher data utilization, capabilities, and integration across the organization. An early-stage startup can have greater data maturity than a 100-year-old company with annual revenues in the billions. What matters is the way data is leveraged as a competitive advantage. Data maturity models have many versions, such as Data Management Maturity (DMM). Usually has three stages: 
	- Starting W/ Data 
	- Scaling  W/ Data
	- Leading W/ Data
